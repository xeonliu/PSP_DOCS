<!-- hp1 --><b>Overview of PlayStation&reg;Store</b><br>
</a>
</h3>
<div style="margin-left:50px;">PlayStation&reg;Store is the online store of the PlayStation&reg;Network commerce service. The products provided in PlayStation&reg;Store can be configured using a combination of two types of data. One is DRM content (a program or data downloaded by the user) and the other is service entitlement (entitlement data managed on the NP server).<br><br></div>

<!-- hp1 --><b>Regional Store and Title Store</b><br>
</a>
</h3>
<div style="margin-left:50px;">PlayStation&reg;Store consists of the Regional Store, which can be accessed from the system software menu, and the Title Store, which can be accessed from the application.<br>The Regional Store is run by country/region. When the user selects "PlayStation&reg;Store" from the system software menu, the Regional Store of the user's country/region of residence can be accessed. A list of products offered for the region will be displayed. In other words, the Regional Store can be used without any dependency on the application. It is appropriate for selling downloadable games or distributing demo games, for example.<br></div>

<!-- sce_hd6 -->
<a name="Heading6_2_2_1">
<div style="margin-left:63px;"><h4><b>Note</b><br><br></h4></a></div>
<div style="margin-left:80px;">If you are planning to sell or distribute a product from the Regional Store, please contact SCE.<br><br></div>

<b>Figure 2  Regional Store</b><br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left:50px;">The Title Store is unique to an application, and cannot be accessed from the system software screen or from a different application. The process of purchasing a product entails the obtainment of the product list from within the application, and having the end user select a product (create and provide an appropriate user interface) to make a purchase. Product list obtainment and purchase processing can be performed using the NP IN-GAME commerce 2 utility APIs. The Title Store is appropriate for selling and distributing additional items to be used in the application, for example.<br></div>

<!-- sce_hd6 -->
<a name="Heading6_2_2_2">
<div style="margin-left:63px;"><h4><b>Note</b><br><br></h4></a></div>
<div style="margin-left:80px;">With the PlayStation&reg;3 NP IN-GAME commerce 2 utility, the entire process (from obtaining the product list to displaying the products and purchase processing) can be executed by calling up features of the system software.<br></div>

<div style="margin-left:50px;">A catalog manages the products and categorization information of products displayed in the Regional Store and Title Store. Products available in both stores are placed on the same server, but the availability in the respective stores will depend on the catalogs, which are created separately for each store. The catalog for the Regional Store is called a global catalog and the catalog for the Title Store is called an in-game catalog.<br>The categories to which a product belongs can be configured as necessary, as shown in the sample tree structures below.<br><br></div>

<!-- hp1 --><b>Wallet</b><br>
</a>
</h3>
<div style="margin-left:50px;">Payment in PlayStation&reg;Store is made by deducting the price of a product from the user's "wallet", which should be charged with a certain amount of money beforehand by the user. This wallet system enables the efficient sales of relatively inexpensive products.<br>A wallet unit corresponds to the currency unit of the applicable country/region for the user. Product price must be set in the currency of the country/region to where the product is to be provided. <br>A wallet can only be held by a master account (parent user). The price of a product purchased from a sub-account (child user) will be deducted from the wallet of the master account. If it is necessary to set a limit of monthly spending, a system is provided for doing so.<br></div>

<!-- hp1 --><b>Types of Products Distributed in PlayStation&reg;Store</b><br>
</a>
</h3>
<div style="margin-left:50px;">The products distributed in PlayStation&reg;Store are configured from the following two types of content.<br></div>
<div style="margin-left:40px;"><ul>
<li> DRM content: Software and data downloaded by the user and saved to storage
<li> Service entitlement: Entitlement data managed on the NP server that can have a set validity period or a limited number of usage times
</ul></div>
<div style="margin-left:50px;">The following are some examples.<br></div>

<!-- sce_hd6 -->
<a name="Heading6_3_1_1">
<div style="margin-left:63px;"><h4><b>Downloadable Game Applications</b><br><br></h4></a></div>
<div style="margin-left:80px;">An example of a product that can be distributed from PlayStation&reg;Store is an application that is booted from storage. It is also possible to distribute free trial editions (demos) of game packages.<br>The application will be downloaded and installed by the system, so there is no need for the application to take note of the download and installation processing.<br>On PlayStation&reg;3, downloadable applications are called "HDD boot games". Due to their slight differences, HDD boot games and disc boot games must be developed separately.<br>On PSP&trade;, no such distinction is necessary. It is even possible to create downloadable games from the masters of UMD&trade; games that have already been published.<br></div>

<!-- sce_hd6 -->
<a name="Heading6_3_1_2">
<div style="margin-left:63px;"><h4><b>Additional Items</b><br><br></h4></a></div>
<div style="margin-left:80px;">Data of additional scenarios, characters, and items to be used in the application can be distributed as products. (Multiple additional items can be provided for a single application.) Instead of distributing the actual data, it is also possible to distribute a flag that corresponds to the applicable data.<br>The data is stored to storage as game data, which means that it is stored within the application-specific game data directory. The subdirectory and filename must be specified in advance.<br></div>

<!-- sce_hd6 -->
<a name="Heading6_3_1_3">
<div style="margin-left:63px;"><h4><b>Demo + License Key</b><br><br></h4></a></div>
<div style="margin-left:80px;">On PlayStation&reg;3, users are allowed to "purchase games". This mechanism can also be used to distribute free trial versions of applications, with certain restrictions in functionality, and then sell license keys to unlock the restrictions.<br></div>

<!-- sce_hd6 -->
<a name="Heading6_3_1_4">
<div style="margin-left:63px;"><h4><b>Custom Themes</b><br><br></h4></a></div>
<div style="margin-left:80px;">Theme files can be distributed for PlayStation&reg;3. These include customized icons and background images for the system software.<br></div>

<!-- sce_hd6 -->
<a name="Heading6_3_1_5">
<div style="margin-left:63px;"><h4><b>Consumable Items</b><br><br></h4></a></div>
<div style="margin-left:80px;">Consumable items can be realized using service entitlements, the right to consume an item a certain number of times. Ammunition is an example of a consumable item, which can be used only a certain number of times in a game.<br>The number of times a service entitlement has been used is managed on the NP server. The application must use the ticketing API in the SDK to find out the number of usable times left in an item and to notify the server of the number consumed. Thus, even if data on storage is lost due to hardware problems or user operation, the number of times an item has been used can be managed safely.<br></div>

<!-- sce_hd6 -->
<a name="Heading6_3_1_6">
<div style="margin-left:63px;"><h4><b>Subscription</b><br><br></h4></a></div>
<div style="margin-left:80px;">Monthly billing of game server accesses for MMORPG and other fee-based subscription services can be realized using service entitlements with validity periods. It is also possible to provide subscription services without a validity period, or to set automatic updates for services that reach their expiration date.<br>There are three ways to determine whether a service is available to a user. The first is for the application to use a ticketing API and obtain information from the NP server. The second is for the game server to use a service called S2S to obtain the relevant information from the NP server. The third method is for the application to obtain information from the NP server via a ticketing API, transfer the data to the game server, and then have the game server use a library called TCM to determine the availability of the service.<br></div>

<!-- sce_title -->
<a Name ="HeadingT_3_1_6_2">
<div style="margin-left:40px;"><h4><b>Eligibility Rules</b><br><br></h4></div></a>

<div style="margin-left:67px;">PlayStation&reg;Store makes use of eligibility rules, which control the display of products to a user depending on the user's purchase history. For example, it is possible to show the expansion pack for a game only to users who have purchased the actual game, or to allow the user to choose from two possible expansion packs.<br></div>

<a href="#Heading3_3"> 3. </a>2 
<!-- hp1 --><b>Product Structure</b><br>
</a>
</h3>
<div style="margin-left:50px;">The products distributed through PlayStation&reg;Store have a hierarchical structure as shown in the figure below, with "Title", "Product", and "SKU" layers. DRM content and service entitlements are linked to the SKU layer.<br><br></div>

<!-- sce_title -->
<a Name ="HeadingT_3_2_3">
<div style="margin-left:40px;"><h4><b>Title</b><br><br></h4></div></a>

<div style="margin-left:67px;">A title is identified by its Service ID. It is possible to set each title with information of the country/region where it is available, and the rating per country/region.<br></div>

<!-- sce_hd6 -->
<a name="Heading6_3_2_1">
<div style="margin-left:63px;"><h4><b>Note</b><br><br></h4></a></div>
<div style="margin-left:80px;">Currently, a Service ID must not be shared among multiple license areas. Register a Service ID for each area that the title is available.<br></div>

<!-- sce_title -->
<a Name ="HeadingT_3_2_1_4">
<div style="margin-left:40px;"><h4><b>Product</b><br><br></h4></div></a>

<div style="margin-left:67px;">A Product refers to a single product unit. Each Product can have information of the countries/regions where it is available, age restrictions, and rating. Products are not assigned prices. The price is set to the SKU.<br></div>

<!-- sce_title -->
<a Name ="HeadingT_3_2_1_5">
<div style="margin-left:40px;"><h4><b>SKU</b><br><br></h4></div></a>

<div style="margin-left:67px;">An SKU is the unit of purchase. Usually, one Product corresponds to one SKU, but it is also possible for one Product to have multiple SKUs, as in the examples below.<br></div>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left:70px;"><ul>
<li> When providing consumable items in different quantities (sets of 5, 10, 50, etc.)
<li> When providing subscriptions with different validity periods (1 month, 3 months, 6 months, etc.)
</ul></div>
<div style="margin-left:67px;">These types of products are displayed under a single Product in PlayStation&reg;Store, and the user will make a selection for the purchase.<br></div>

<!-- sce_hd6 -->
<a name="Heading6_3_2_2">
<div style="margin-left:63px;"><h4><b>Note</b><br><br></h4></a></div>
<div style="margin-left:80px;">Contact SCE when considering these types of products.<br><br></div>
<div style="margin-left:67px;">In certain instances, it is necessary for one Product to have multiple SKUs, in order to set appropriate eligibility rules.<br><br>An SKU must have at least one DRM content or service entitlement assigned to it. One SKU can have multiple DRM content or service entitlements. It is also possible to assign the same DRM content or service entitlement to different SKUs.<br>When the user purchases an SKU, the user has purchased the DRM content or service entitlement linked to that SKU.<br></div>

<!-- sce_hd6 -->
<a name="Heading6_3_2_3">
<div style="margin-left:63px;"><h4><b>Note</b><br><br></h4></a></div>
<div style="margin-left:80px;">To prevent users from mistakenly purchasing the same SKU, an SKU for a fee cannot be checked out (though it is visible) if all the DRM content and service entitlements associated with the SKU have already been purchased by the user, and furthermore, there are no restrictions such as validity periods or number of usable times.<br>For example, suppose item A and item B are available singly, but also as a paired set. If A and B have been purchased individually, the set, though visible, will not be available for purchase.<br>This kind of product configuration requires an appropriate configuration of eligibility rules.<br></div>
<div style="margin-left:67px;"><br>The price of an SKU is set per country/region in the local currency. Set both a suggested retail price and a wholesale price. A price based on these figures will be set by SCE in PlayStation&reg;Store.<br><br>The validity period or number of usable times of a service entitlement is set to the SKU, and not the service entitlement itself.<br>Eligibility rules are also set to the SKU.<br></div>

<!-- sce_hd6 -->
<a name="Heading6_3_2_4">
<div style="margin-left:63px;"><h4><b>Note</b><br><br></h4></a></div>
<div style="margin-left:80px;">The SKU described here is the Standard SKU. Other types of SKUs exist, but are not usually used: the ContentLink SKU for distributing movies and images without DRM protection, and the Voucher SKU for the PlayStation&reg;Network Card and PlayStation&reg;Network Ticket.<br></div>

<!-- sce_title -->
<a Name ="HeadingT_3_2_4_6">
<div style="margin-left:40px;"><h4><b>DRM Content</b><br><br></h4></div></a>

<div style="margin-left:67px;">DRM content is a product provided in the form of downloadable software. One DRM content corresponds to one "NPDRM package", which has the encoded program and data files in a prescribed format.<br>There are different NPDRM packages types for different purposes.?<br></div>
</ol>
<div style="margin-left:40px;"><ul>
<li> PlayStation&reg;3
</ul></div>
<div style="margin-left:70px;"><ul>
<li> Game data package
<li> HDD boot game package
<li> License key package
<li> Custom theme package
</ol></div>
<div style="margin-left:40px;"><ul>
<li> PSP&trade;
</ul></div>
<div style="margin-left:70px;"><ul>
<li> Downloadable game package
<li> Additional game data package
</ul></div>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left:67px;">When the user purchases and downloads DRM content, the corresponding NPDRM package is installed to storage. Access rights to the installed files are managed according to the user's PlayStation&reg;Network account. This prevents the files from being accessed if they are simply copied to storage (not installed per the official method). Encoding helps prevent file tampering, and setting an encoding key can prevent the data from being read by illicit programs.<br></div>

<!-- sce_hd6 -->
<a name="Heading6_3_2_5">
<div style="margin-left:63px;"><h4><b>Note</b><br><br></h4></a></div>
<div style="margin-left:80px;">Typical product configurations with DRM content and the necessary precautions are available in the following documents.<br></div>
<div style="margin-left:70px;"><ul>
<li> PlayStation&reg;3: "PlayStation&reg;Store Content Guidelines"
<li> PSP&trade;: "PSP&trade; PlayStation&reg;Store Content Guidelines"
</ul></div>

<!-- sce_title -->
<a Name ="HeadingT_3_2_5_7">
<div style="margin-left:40px;"><h4><b>Service Entitlement</b><br><br></h4></div></a>

<div style="margin-left:67px;">A service entitlement is a product that gives certain privileges to the user. It can be a subscription to game play, or the rights to use a certain item in a game. Entitlements are managed on the NP server. The application obtains a "ticket" from the NP server to see if the user has certain privileges.<br><br>It is possible to set validity periods (the number of days a user will be able to use the entitlement after the purchase) or the number of usable times. These restrictions are not specified to the service entitlement itself, but to the SKU linked with the service entitlement.<br><br>If a validity period is specified, the user will lose the entitlement after the set period passes, and the tickets obtained from the NP server will no longer include entitlement information. The application simply needs to check if a ticket includes entitlement information; if there is no entitlement information, the entitlement has either expired or has not been purchased.<br>If the user purchases the service entitlement again within the validity period, the validity period is extended.<br>It is also possible to set a validity period that is automatically extended. In other words, when the validity period ends, the user's wallet is automatically charged for extending the validity period.<br></div>

<!-- sce_hd6 -->
<a name="Heading6_3_2_6">
<div style="margin-left:63px;"><h4><b>Note</b><br><br></h4></a></div>
<div style="margin-left:80px;">Contact SCE in advance to use the automatic extension feature.<br></div>
<div style="margin-left:67px;"><br>If the number of usable times is set, the application can obtain information from the NP server to find out how many more times the user is allowed to use the service entitlement. The application can also send a request to the NP server to have a specified number of times consumed.<br></div>

<hr noshade>
</h2>

<div style="margin-left:50px;">The PSP&trade; system is built around an integrated chip PSP&trade; Engine with a 32-bit RISC CPU core as shown in the following figure.<br></div>

 2 <!-- hp --><b>PSP&trade; Engine</b>
<hr noshade>
</h2>

<div style="margin-left:50px;">The PSP&trade; Engine is designed as an integrated chip that is broadly divided into three blocks.<br></div>
<div style="margin-left:40px;"><ul>
<li> Main CPU block for controlling the entire PSP&trade; system
<li> Media Engine block mainly for processing audio and video formats
<li> Peripheral block for performing I/O with peripheral devices that are connected externally to the PSP&trade; Engine
</ul></div>
<div style="margin-left:50px;">The features of each block are described below.<br></div>

<!-- sce_hd4 -->
<a name="Heading4_2_1">
<h3>
<a href="#Heading3_2"> 2. </a>1 
<!-- hp1 --><b>Main CPU Block</b><br>
</a>
</h3>
<div style="margin-left:50px;">This block controls the entire system. It contains a 32-bit MIPS architecture CPU core (ALLEGREX) which has an FPU / VFPU (4FMAC), a Graphics Engine (GE) that can perform surface processing, and internal memory (eDRAM). The CPU is capable of running general-purpose applications.<br>ALLEGREX is a 32-bit RISC CPU with a 7-stage pipeline that executes the MIPS-III (and part of the MIPS IV) instruction set. It has FPU and VFPU coprocessors which can each perform single-precision floating-point operations. (Double-precision operations cannot be performed.) The FPU, which is an ordinary FPU in the MIPS architecture, is suitable for performing ordinary arithmetic operations. The VFPU, on the other hand, is a coprocessor that has a proprietary instruction set that can perform matrix operations and triangle functions, which are often used in games, in a single instruction. The VFPU is optimized for vector processing.<br>The GE is a rendering engine with a fixed pipeline that can perform vertex coordinate transformation, light source processing, and drawing processing. It is connected to an internal 2MiB eDRAM via a 512-bit bus, and is capable of high-speed drawing.<br></div>

<a href="#Heading3_2"> 2. </a>2 
<!-- hp1 --><b>Media Engine Block</b><br>
</a>
</h3>
<div style="margin-left:50px;">This block can play various video and audio codecs such as MPEG4 AVC and ATRAC3plus&trade;, and it can also perform signal processing. It consists of a decoder implemented in hardware, the VME signal processor, and an associated controller. The block also contains its own eDRAM so that even when codecs are running that require frequent memory accesses, other blocks will not be affected.<br>Applications can use the Media Engine block via device drivers provided by the operating system.<br></div>

<a href="#Heading3_2"> 2. </a>3 
<!-- hp1 --><b>Peripheral Block</b><br>
</a>
</h3>
<div style="margin-left:50px;">This block is used for connecting I/O devices besides RAM and ROM. Applications can use the Peripheral block via device drivers provided by the operating system. For descriptions of peripheral devices, see the next chapter.<br></div>

<a href="#Heading3_3"> 3. </a>1 
<!-- hp1 --><b>System Flash Memory</b><br>
</a>
</h3>
<div style="margin-left:50px;">The operating system of the PSP&trade; is stored in system flash memory. System flash memory is not directly accessible from an ordinary application.<br></div>

<!-- sce_hd4 -->
<a name="Heading4_3_2">
<h3>
<a href="#Heading3_3"> 3. </a>2 
<!-- hp1 --><b>Main Memory</b><br>
</a>
</h3>
<div style="margin-left:50px;">Besides internal memory (eDRAM), the PSP&trade; Engine has 32 MB of main memory. Main memory is accessible from each block of the PSP&trade; Engine. Note that a development system has more memory than an actual system.<br></div>

<a href="#Heading3_3"> 3. </a>3 
<!-- hp1 --><b>UMD&trade; Drive and UMD&trade; Controller</b><br>
</a>
</h3>
<div style="margin-left:50px;">PSP&trade; systems from the PSP-1000 to the PSP-3000 are equipped with a UMD&trade; drive.<br>A UMD&trade; is a dual-layer 60-mm disc media with a capacity of 1.8 GB.<br>The read performance of the drive built into the PSP&trade; system is 11 to 22 Mbps (fixed angular velocity, theoretical value) and it has a built-in anti-shock buffer memory intended for mobile use. Note that although the read speed is roughly 8 to 16 times that of a CD-ROM drive, the seek speed is rather slow. This restriction results from drive size and power consumption limitations.<br></div>

<a href="#Heading3_3"> 3. </a>4 
<!-- hp1 --><b>LCD</b><br>
</a>
</h3>
<div style="margin-left:50px;">The LCD installed in the PSP&trade; system has a size of 480x272 dots and is capable of backlighting. The aspect ratio is 16:9 (pixel aspect ratio is 1:1).<br>The diagonal size is 4.3 inches for PSP&trade; systems from the PSP-1000 to the PSP-3000 and 3.8 inches for the PSP-N1000.<br></div>

<!-- hp1 --><b>Internal Flash Memory and Memory Stick&trade;</b><br>
</a>
</h3>
<div style="margin-left:50px;">PSP&trade; systems from the PSP-1000 to the PSP-3000 are equipped with a Memory Stick&trade; slot, and the PSP-N1000 is equipped with internal flash memory of approximately 16 GB in addition to a Memory Stick&trade; slot.<br>The internal flash memory or the Memory Stick&trade; can be used as the target for saving game data.<br></div>

<a href="#Heading3_3"> 3. </a>6 
<!-- hp1 --><b>WLAN</b><br>

<h3>
<a href="#Heading3_3"> 3. </a>7 
<!-- hp1 --><b>Controller</b><br>
</a>
</h3>
<div style="margin-left:50px;">The following buttons are included in the PSP&trade; system.<br><br></div>
<div style="margin-left:40px;"><ul>
<li> START button
<li> SELECT button
<li> Directional buttons (up, down, left, and right)
<li> <img src="gif/PSP_System_Overview-English002.gif"> button
<li> X  button
<li> <img src="gif/PSP_System_Overview-English003.gif"> button

<li> R button
<li> L button
<li> Analog pad
<li> HOLD switch
<li> POWER switch
<li> PS button (HOME button)
</ul></div>
<div style="margin-left:50px;"><br>Since the POWER switch and PS button (HOME button) are processed by the system, they cannot be used by a general application.<br>When a button is pressed, associated state information is received by the "SysCon" block and regularly reported to the main CPU.<br><br></div>

 4 <!-- hp --><b>Power Management</b>
<hr noshade>
</h2>

<div style="margin-left:50px;">The PSP&trade; system is equipped with a sleep function (suspend/resume feature) and game sleep function (hibernation feature). Since these sleep functions are invoked by the user, an application running on the PSP&trade; system must handle these requests as quickly as possible.<br>A network connection or timer action may also cause processing to resume from a suspend state (without user intervention).<br>There is also a feature that automatically turns off backlighting and transitions the system to sleep or standby mode when no operation has been detected after a certain amount of time has elapsed.<br>For details, refer to the Power Service Overview.<br><br></div>
